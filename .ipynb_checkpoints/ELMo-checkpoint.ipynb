    "The ELMo Language model constists of the following componenets:\n",
    "- The model inputs a sequence of words\n",
    "- Each word is broken down into their respective characters, where each caracter is then one-hot encoded to form a sparse matrix for every word.\n",
    "- Each matrix is then multiplied by a learned embedding matrix to reduce the dimentionality into a dense character matrix\n",
    "- The dense character matrix is then input into a CNN to generate a character-level representation of each of the words in the input sequence\n",
    "- The character-level representations are then input into the 2 bi-directional LSTM layers, to process the input sequence both forwards and backwards\n",
    "- The outputs for each layer is then concatinated and using to get a weighted average of the input embeddings\n",
    "- Final contextualized word embeddings are then obtained the weighted average of the input words with the original word embeddings (those generated with the learned embedding matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the CNN over the character matrix allows the model to capture more nuanced relations between characters and words, as well as to be able to process out-of-vocabulary words. After this, the bidirectional language model allows the words in the input sequence to gain context from both directions, rather than just forward. Overall, these components allows the model to capture more complex linguistic phenomena and it has shown through various benchmarks to outperform almost all other existing models at the time."
